TikTok CEO Shou Chew has been invited to and is expected to attend President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration Monday, according to three sources familiar with the matter, two of whom are Trump transition officials. Chew was invited by the president-elect's team and will sit on the dais in front of the Capitol where Trump will be sworn in as president. Chew is expected to sit alongside the CEOs and leaders of other Big Tech platforms, including Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, according to one of the officials. Google CEO Sundar Pichai is also planning to attend and sit with the other executives, one Trump transition official said. NBC News has reached out to representatives of TikTok and Google for comment. TikTok declined to comment and Google did not immediately respond. The New York Times was the first outlet to report about Chew’s inauguration attendance. Chew’s attendance comes as the popular TikTok app is preparing to possibly shut down Sunday, the day a U.S. ban is set to go into effect if the Supreme Court doesn’t overrule it. The nine justices on the conservative-majority court heard oral arguments last week about whether to implement the ban that was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Joe Biden last year. Remarks and questions by the justices during the arguments suggested it was likely they would uphold the law that would effectively ban the platform.
